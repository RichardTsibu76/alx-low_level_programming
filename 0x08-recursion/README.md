Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is recursion
How to implement recursion
In what situations you should implement recursion
In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
mandatory
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.
